				<h2>What is Arthritis?</h2>

				Arthritis, in general terms, is inflammation and swelling of the cartilage and lining of the joints, generally accompanied by an increase in the fluid in the joints. Arthritis has multiple causes; just as a sore throat may have its origin in a variety of diseases, so joint inflammation and arthritis are associated with many different illnesses.
<br /><br />
				Arthritis is a frequent component of complex diseases that may involve more than 100 identifiable disorders. If the feet seem more susceptible to arthritis than other parts of the body, it is because each foot has 33 joints that can be afflicted and there is no way to avoid the pain of the tremendous weight-bearing load on the feet.
<br /><br />
				Arthritis is a disabling and occasionally crippling disease; it afflicts almost 40 million Americans. In some forms, it appears to have hereditary tendencies. While the prevalence of arthritis increases with age, all people from infancy to middle age are potential victims. People over 50 are most prone to arthritis.
<br /><br />
				Arthritic feet can result in loss of mobility and independence, but early diagnosis and proper medical care can help significantly.<br /><br />
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			Besides heredity, arthritic symptoms may arise in a number of ways:
			<ul>
				<li>Through injuries, notably in athletes and industrial workers, especially if the injuries have been ignored (which injuries of the feet tend to be).</li>
				<li>Through bacterial and viral infections that strike the joints. The same organisms that are present in pneumonia, gonorrhea, staph infections, and Lyme disease cause the inflammations.</li>
				<li>In conjunction with bowel disorders such as colitis and ileitis, frequently resulting in arthritic conditions in the joints of the ankles and toes. Such inflammatory bowel diseases seem distant from arthritis, but treating them can relieve arthritic pain.</li>
				<li>Using drugs, both prescription drugs and illegal street drugs, can induce arthritis.</li>
				<li>As part of a congenital autoimmune disease syndrome of undetermined origin. Recent research has suggested, for instance, that a defective gene may play a role in osteoarthritis.</li>
</ul>

				Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It is frequently called degenerative joint disease or “wear and tear” arthritis. Although it can be brought on suddenly by an injury, its onset is generally gradual; aging brings on a breakdown in cartilage, and pain gets progressively more severe, although it can be relieved with rest. Dull, throbbing nighttime pain is characteristic, and it may be accompanied by muscle weakness or deterioration. Walking may become erratic. It is a particular problem for the feet when people are overweight, simply because there are so many joints in each foot. The additional weight contributes to the deterioration of cartilage and the development of bone spurs.

			RA is a major crippling disorder and perhaps the most serious form of arthritis. It is a complex, chronic inflammatory system of diseases, often affecting more than a dozen smaller joints during the course of the disease, frequently in a symmetrical pattern—both ankles, or the index fingers of both hands, for example. It is often accompanied by signs and symptoms—lengthy morning stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss—and it may affect various systems of the body, such as the eyes, lungs, heart, and nervous system. Women are three or four times more likely than men to suffer RA.
			<br /> <br />
			RA has a much more acute onset than osteoarthritis. It is characterized by alternating periods of remission, during which symptoms disappear, and exacerbation, marked by the return of inflammation, stiffness, and pain. Serious joint deformity and loss of motion frequently result from acute RA. However, the disease system has been known to be active for months, or years, then abate, sometimes permanently.

			<div data-role="content" data-theme="f" style="border-style: none;" style="border-style: none;" >
				 Gout is a condition caused by a buildup of the salts of uric acid—a normal byproduct of the diet—in the joints. A single big toe joint is commonly the affected area, possibly because it is subject to so much pressure in walking; attacks of gouty arthritis are extremely painful, perhaps more so than any other form of arthritis. Men are much more likely to be afflicted than women, an indication that heredity may play a role in the disease. While a rich diet that contains lots of red meat, rich sauces, shellfish, and brandy is popularly associated with gout, there are other protein compounds in foods such as lentils and beans that may play a role.

				 Psoriasis is often thought of as a skin disorder, but it can affect the joints as well. On the skin, psoriasis appears as dry, scaly patches. Not all people with psoriasis of the skin will develop joint symptoms—about one in twenty people with psoriasis will develop associated arthritis. The arthritis may be mild and involve only a few joints, particularly those at the ends of the fingers or toes. People who also have arthritis usually have the skin and nail changes of psoriasis. Often, the skin gets worse at the same time as the arthritis.

				Traumatic arthritis is a form of arthritis that is caused by blunt, penetrating, or repeated trauma or from forced inappropriate motion of a joint or ligament. Injury to a joint, such as a bad sprain or fracture, can cause damage to the articular cartilage. This damage to the cartilage eventually leads to arthritic changes in the joint.

				<h3><b>What Is a Bunion?</b></h3>

				A bunion is a “bump” on the joint at the base of the big toe—the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint—that forms when the bone or tissue at the big toe joint moves out of place. The toe is forced to bend toward the others, causing an often painful lump of bone on the foot. Because this joint carries a lot of the body's weight while walking, bunions can cause extreme pain if left untreated. The MTP joint itself may become stiff and sore, making even the wearing of shoes difficult or impossible. A bunion—from the Latin "bunio," meaning enlargement—can also occur on the outside of the foot along the little toe, where it is called a "bunionette" or "tailor's bunion".

				<h1>Causes of Bunions</h1>
				
			</div>
			<div data-role="content" data-theme="f" style="border-style: none;">
			<h3><b>Causes</b></h3>

Bunions form when the normal balance of forces that is exerted on the joints and tendons of the foot becomes disrupted. This disruption can lead to instability in the joint and cause the deformity. Bunions are brought about by years of abnormal motion and pressure over the MTP joint. They are, therefore, a symptom of faulty foot development and are usually caused by the way we walk and our inherited foot type or our shoes.
<br /><br />
Although bunions tend to run in families, it is the foot type that is passed down—not the bunion. Parents who suffer from poor foot mechanics can pass their problematic foot type on to their children, who in turn are prone to developing bunions. The abnormal functioning caused by this faulty foot development can lead to pressure being exerted on and within the foot, often resulting in bone and joint deformities such as bunions and hammertoes.
<br /><br />

Other causes of bunions are foot injuries, neuromuscular disorders, or congenital deformities. People who suffer from flat feet or low arches are also prone to developing these problems, as are arthritic patients and those with inflammatory joint disease. Occupations that place undue stress on the feet are also a factor; ballet dancers, for instance, often develop the condition.
<br /><br />

Wearing shoes that are too tight or cause the toes to be squeezed together is also a common factor, one that explains the high prevalence of the disorder among women.

			<h3><b>What Is Diabetes?</b></h3>

Diabetes is the inability to manufacture or properly use insulin, and it impairs the body's ability to convert sugars, starches, and other foods into energy. The long-term effects of elevated blood sugar (hyperglycemia) can lead to serious damage to the eyes, heart, kidney, nerves, and feet. Diabetes affects the lives of nearly 26 million people in the United States and nearly seven million don't even know they have the disease yet.
<br /><br />
While there is no cure for diabetes, there is hope. With proper diet, exercise, medical care, and careful management at home, a person with diabetes can avoid the most serious complications and enjoy a full and active life. Today's podiatrist plays a key role in helping patients manage diabetes successfully and avoid foot-related complications.

			Because diabetes is a disease affecting many parts of the body, successful management requires a team approach. A podiatrist plays an integral part of the treatment team and has documented success in preventing amputations:
	<ul>
		<li> More than 65,000 lower limbs are amputated annually due to complications from diabetes.</li>
		<li>After an amputation, the chance of another amputation within three to five years is as high as 50 percent.</li>
		<li> Including a podiatrist in your diabetes care can reduce the risk of lower limb amputation up to 85 percent and lowers the risk of hospitalization by 24 percent.</li>
	</ul>

The keys to amputation prevention are early recognition and regular foot screenings performed by a podiatrist, the foot and ankle expert.

			<div data-role="content" data-theme="f" style="border-style: none;">
			<h3><b>Take Action</b></h3>
			If you have diabetes, follow these foot care tips:
<ul>
	<li>Inspect feet daily. Check your feet and toes every day for cuts, bruises, sores, or changes to the toenails, such as thickening or discoloration.</li>
	<li>Wear thick, soft socks. Avoid socks with seams, which could rub and cause blisters or other skin injuries.</li>
	<li>Exercise. Walking can keep weight down and improve circulation. Be sure to wear appropriate athletic shoes when exercising.</li>
	<li>Have new shoes properly measured and fitted. Foot size and shape may change over time. Shoes that fit properly are important to those with diabetes.</li>

				<h3><b>What is a Diabetic Foot Ulcer?</b></h3>

A diabetic foot ulcer is an open sore or wound that occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients with diabetes and is commonly located on the bottom of the foot. Of those who develop a foot ulcer, 6 percent will be hospitalized due to infection or other ulcer-related complication.
<br /><br />
Diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations in the United States, and approximately 14-24 percent of patients with diabetes who develop a foot ulcer will require an amputation. Foot ulceration precedes 85 percent of diabetes-related amputations. Research has shown, however, that development of a foot ulcer is preventable.

				<h3><b>Ulceration Causes</b></h3>

Anyone who has diabetes can develop a foot ulcer. Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and older men are more likely to develop ulcers. People who use insulin are at higher risk of developing a foot ulcer, as are patients with diabetes-related kidney, eye, and heart disease. Being overweight and using alcohol and tobacco also play a role in the development of foot ulcers.  
<br /><br />
Ulcers form due to a combination of factors, such as lack of feeling in the foot, poor circulation, foot deformities, irritation (such as friction or pressure), and trauma, as well as duration of diabetes. Patients who have diabetes for many years can develop neuropathy, a reduced or complete lack of ability to feel pain in the feet due to nerve damage caused by elevated blood glucose levels over time. The nerve damage often can occur without pain, and one may not even be aware of the problem. Your podiatrist can test feet for neuropathy with a simple, painless tool called a monofilament.
<br /><br />
Vascular disease can complicate a foot ulcer, reducing the body's ability to heal and increasing the risk for an infection. Elevations in blood glucose can reduce the body's ability to fight off a potential infection and also slow healing.

			Because many people who develop foot ulcers have lost the ability to feel pain, pain is not a common symptom. Many times, the first thing you may notice is some drainage on your socks. Redness and swelling may also be associated with the ulceration and, if it has progressed significantly, odor may be present.

			<h3><b>Foot Ulceration Treatments</b></h3>
The primary goal in the treatment of foot ulcers is to obtain healing as soon as possible. The faster the healing, the less chance for an infection.
<br /> <br />
There are several key factors in the appropriate treatment of a diabetic foot ulcer:
<ul>
    <li>Prevention of infection</li>
    <li>Taking the pressure off the area, called “off-loading”</li>
    <li>Removing dead skin and tissue, called “debridement”</li>
    <li>Applying medication or dressings to the ulcer </li>
    <li>Managing blood glucose and other health problems</li>
</ul>
Not all ulcers are infected; however, if your podiatrist diagnoses an infection, a treatment program of antibiotics, wound care, and possibly hospitalization will be necessary.
<br /><br />
To keep an ulcer from becoming infected, it is important to:
<ul>
    <li>keep blood glucose levels under tight control </li>
    <li>keep the ulcer clean and bandaged;</li>
    <li>cleanse the wound daily, using a wound dressing or bandage; and</li>
    <li>avoid walking barefoot.</li>
</ul>
For optimum healing, ulcers, especially those on the bottom of the foot, must be “off-loaded.”  You may be asked to wear special footgear, or a brace, specialized castings, or use a wheelchair or crutches.  These devices will reduce the pressure and irritation to the area with the ulcer and help to speed the healing process.
<br /><br />
The science of wound care has advanced significantly over the past ten years. The old thought of “let the air get at it” is now known to be harmful to healing. We know that wounds and ulcers heal faster, with a lower risk of infection, if they are kept covered and moist. The use of full-strength betadine, hydrogen peroxide, whirlpools, and soaking are not recommended, as these practices could lead to further complications.
<br /><br />
Appropriate wound management includes the use of dressings and topically-applied medications. Products range from normal saline to growth factors, ulcer dressings, and skin substitutes that have been shown to be highly effective in healing foot ulcers.
<br /><br />
For a wound to heal, there must be adequate circulation to the ulcerated area. Your podiatrist can determine circulation levels with noninvasive tests. 
<br /><br />
Tightly controlling blood glucose is of the utmost importance during the treatment of a diabetic foot ulcer. Working closely with a medical doctor or endocrinologist to control blood glucose will enhance healing and reduce the risk of complications.
<br /><br />
Surgical Options: A majority of non-infected foot ulcers are treated without surgery; however, if this treatment method fails, surgical management may be appropriate. Examples of surgical care to remove pressure on the affected area include shaving or excision of bone(s) and the correction of various deformities, such as hammertoes, bunions, or bony “bumps.”
<br /><br />
Healing time depends on a variety of factors, such as wound size and location, pressure on the wound from walking or standing, swelling, circulation, blood glucose levels, wound care, and what is being applied to the wound. Healing may occur within weeks or require several months.

				<h3><b>Ulceration Prevention</b></h3>
The best way to treat a diabetic foot ulcer is to prevent its development in the first place. Recommended guidelines include seeing a podiatrist on a regular basis. Your podiatrist can determine if you are at high risk for developing a foot ulcer and implement strategies for prevention.
<br /><br />
You are at high risk if you have or do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Neuropathy</li>
   <li> Poor circulation</li>
   <li> A foot deformity (e.g., bunion, hammer toe)</li>
   <li> Wear inappropriate shoes</li>
   <li> Uncontrolled blood sugar</li>
   <li> History of a previous foot ulceration </li>
</ul>
Reducing additional risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, high cholesterol, and elevated blood glucose, are important in prevention and treatment of a diabetic foot ulcer. Wearing the appropriate shoes and socks will go a long way in reducing risks. Your podiatrist can provide guidance in selecting the proper shoes.
<br /><br />
Learning how to check your feet is crucial so that you can find a potential problem as early as possible. Inspect your feet every day—especially the sole and between the toes—for cuts, bruises, cracks, blisters, redness, ulcers, and any sign of abnormality. Each time you visit a health-care provider, remove your shoes and socks so your feet can be examined. Any problems that are discovered should be reported to your podiatrist as soon as possible; no matter how simple they may seem to you. 
<br /><br />
The key to successful wound healing is regular podiatric medical care to ensure the following “gold standard” of care:
<ul>
    <li>Lowering blood sugar</li>
   <li> Appropriate debridement of wounds</li>
  <li>  Treating any infection</li>
  <li>  Reducing friction and pressure</li>
  <li>  Restoring adequate blood flow</li>
</ul>

			<h3><b>About High Blood Pressure</b></h3>
High blood pressure is also known as hypertension. Blood pressure refers to the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as your heart pumps out blood. Hypertension occurs when your blood pressure rises and stays above normal over a period of time.
<br /> <br />
Hypertension is often related to atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque in blood vessels. This condition leads to decreased circulation and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  People with decreased circulation in their legs and feet may develop ulcerations (open wounds on the skin) that can lead to amputations.
<br /> <br />
As a member of the health-care team, your podiatrist is vitally concerned about hypertension and vascular disease (heart and circulatory problems). Make sure you tell your podiatrist if you have high blood pressure and any medications that you may be taking for treatment.

	<li>Sores on the feet or legs that do not heal or take a long time to heal</li>
	<li>Changes in color to the feet</li>
	<li>Changes in temperature to the feet</li>
	<li> Loss of hair on the feet and legs</li>

				As part of your visit, your podiatrist may check your vital signs—height, weight, and blood pressure. Your podiatrist will conduct a careful examination to determine if there is lower than normal temperature in any of the extremities, absence of normal skin color, or diminished pulse in the feet. Your podiatrist will also ask you about increased or periodic swelling in the lower extremities.
		<br /><br />
If any abnormalities in your blood pressure are noted, your podiatrist will notify you and may refer you to your primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment.

			<h3><b>About PVD</b></h3>	
				PVD is short for Peripheral Vascular Disease. PVD is caused by a blockage or narrowing of the veins in the legs when fatty deposits called plaque buildup. The buildup of plaque causes the veins to harden and narrow. This results in a reduction of blood flow to the legs and feet. This is commonly referred to as poor circulation.
<br /><br />
PVD occurs most often in the veins in the legs, but it can also affect other arteries that carry blood outside the heart. 
<br /><br />
PVD affects 8 to 12 million Americans, and one in every five people over the age of 70 has the disease. People with PVD have a two-to-six times' greater chance of death from a heart attack or stroke. PVD and diabetes are the leading causes of foot or leg amputations in the United States.
